# Vade Mecum

_Vade Mecum_ is a TTRPG system that attempts to create a universal rule set for any type of tabletop adventure.
This core rule book was made to be universe-agnostic, allowing it to plug right into any pre-made or homebrew universe you would like to use.
At its core, _Vade Mecum_ is a definition of general RPG mechanics, rather than a pre-baked system that must be twisted and bent to work for your adventure.

Although, we also know that the most important part of any RPG is its world.
It's what gives the characters life and the adventures meaning.
This is why _Vade Mecum_ provides a number of official World Kits that give you all the resources you need to start adventuring with our system.
And once you're ready, we encourage you to tweak our World Kits or build your own to make a truly unique _Vade Mecum_ experience.

Foundationally, _Vade Mecum_ is a system of mechanics that defines how characters adventure in the world.
The core characters are those controlled by the players, each of which are motivated to achieve their own personal goals.
These characters form an Adventuring Party that share a higher, mutual goal, driving them on a challenging adventure through the world.
The world is defined and controlled by a Game Master that acts as both the game's arbiter and storyteller, motivated to make the adventure as fun and engaging as possible.

# 1. World

The world is the universe the characters exist to adventure in, forming the most critical part of the role-playing aspect of your game.
Based on the world, there will be different races and adventuring classes, different weapons, armor, and items used by the characters, and different adventures and enemies that can be faced.

## 1.1 World Kits

World Kits are pre-configured worlds that have been built to plug right into the core _Vade Mecum_ rule set.
These kits provide all the resources a Game Master will need to start an adventure, including races, classes, items, and creatures.
We will highlight some of these kits below, but their complete documentation can be found in the kit itself.

## 1.2 Currency

No matter what World Kit is being used, there exists an economic system that uses a single denomination of currency to buy and sell items.
This currency will vary based on the world, using units such as coins, dollars, credits, or bottlecaps as stores of value.
To keep things generic, we refer to these as Currency Units, or CU.

To price items, there are 7 levels of rarity that measure how rare and costly any given item is.
In most adventures, characters begin with the ability to buy items of Average rarity and lower.
Items that are Rare, Very Rare, and Legendary should require PC's to save up currency or succeed on challenging quests.

| Rarity          | Cost   | Example                    |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------------- |
| **Ubiquitous**  | Free   | Cup of water               |
| **Very Common** | 1 CU   | Pint of ale                |
| **Common**      | 5 CU   | Simple meal                |
| **Average**     | 20 CU  | Fancy meal, simple lodging |
| **Rare**        | 100 CU | Light armor, fancy lodging |
| **Very Rare**   | 200 CU | Medium armor               |
| **Legendary**   | 400 CU | Heavy armor                |

> A single Currency Unit is of little worth by itself, being equivalent to an item of Very Common rarity.
> Stumbling upon a single CU in the world would be unsurprising and unimpactful.

To purchase an item listed in the given World Kit, a character requires a marketplace or merchant that has that item (as dictated by the Game Master).
Additionally, if the item is of Rare rarity or higher, a Barter check is required to determine how effective the character is in haggling the price down.

| Result    | Outcome                                |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Success   | You haggle the price down 10%.         |
| Stalemate | You find the item priced as expected.  |
| Failure   | The merchant haggles the price up 10%. |

> **Example:** A character looks to buy some Heavy Armor (Legendary) in a large marketplace and the GM rules that the item is being sold there.
> The character rolls a Barter check but fails. They have the choice to buy the item for 440 CU or try again tomorrow.

When selling an item of Rare rarity or higher, the same rules apply but in reverse (the character attempts to haggle the price up).

# 2. Characters

A character is a sentient creature that exists in the world, working towards its goals, upholding its ideals, and above all else, trying to survive.
Characters are chiefly defined by attributes, skills, and perks, all of which are deciding factors in just how well it performs at completing those objectives.

> Player characters, or PC's, are characters controlled by the players.
> Non-player characters, or NPC's, are characters controlled by the Game Master.

## 2.1 Attributes

Each character has 5 core attributes that define its physical and mental ability.
These attributes are scored on a scale from 1 to 6, with the average person being a 2.
When a character performs an action, these attribute scores are used to determine how well they do.

| Attribute        | Description                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Strength**     | Measures athletics, endurance, and muscular power       |
| **Dexterity**    | Measures agility, reflexes, and coordination            |
| **Intelligence** | Measures critical thinking, problem solving, and memory |
| **Charisma**     | Measures empathy, persuasiveness, and social influence  |
| **Perception**   | Measures awareness, attention, and insightfulness       |

Within the 5 attributes, each character has one Flaw and one Focus.
A character's Flaw is their glaring weakness—the quality that holds them back from being the perfect adventurer.
Conversely, a character's Focus is their greatest power—the quality that makes them a master of their class.

## 2.2 Skills

Below attributes, characters have 15 core skills that represent proficiencies within a specific attribute area.
These skills are scored on a scale from 0 to 3, with the average human being a 1.
Skills allow characters to specialize themselves towards specific types of actions.

| Attribute    | Skill             | Description                                                        |

| Charisma     | **Speech**        | Persuade or deceive a person                                       |

| Perception   | **Investigation** | Search for clues or objects, scan for details                      |

## 2.3 Perks

Based on skill proficiencies, characters can acquire perks that serve as an expansion of their overall abilities (see [Experience Levels](#2.5-Experience-Levels) for when perks can be acquired).
Each perk falls under a specific skill and will require a minimum level in that skill to acquire.
As such, perks give characters a way to accentuate their strengths in ways that compliment their play style.

| Attribute    | Perk                 | Requirement     | Description                                                                                                               |

## 2.4 Classes

While attributes, skills, and perks are the foundation of a character's abilities, classes are the foundation of a character's identity and nature.
Classes define a character's Focus attribute, as well as gives them access to skills, perks, and items that are otherwise inaccessible to other classes.

> Specific character classes are defined by the World Kit being used, but all classes follow a universal pattern for how they are structured.

Classes grant a character a unique 16th skill that falls under the designated Focus attribute.
This class skill is used to perform class-specific actions and give the character an edge in a specialized area of the world.

Each class provides a unique list of perks that fall under this class skill.
These class perks will often allow the character to evolve its abilities in different ways.

Additionally, each class has a unique type of gear associated with them that serves as a channel for the class's power.
This piece of gear is only attainable by leveling up and will provide bonuses to the class skill.

> An example of a class from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit is given below.

### Knight

Knights are soldiers sworn to uphold the code of chivalry and defend the realm at all costs.
They are a stalwart force on the battlefield, often clad in heavy armor and weaponry and leading the charge against the enemy.
Knights fight for honor and glory, using their strength and martial prowess to defend the helpless from evil.

| Attribute | Skill     | Description                                                          |
| --------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | **Honor** | Persuade others using morality, follow-up attack with a melee weapon |

### Class Item

Every Knight carries a Honorific Banner that bolsters their confidence and allows them to fight with Honor.
This piece of gear is commonly a physical banner with a coat of arms from the house they are sworn to defend.

| Level | Honorific Banner Effect |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | Honor +0                |
| 6     | Honor +1                |
| 12    | Honor +2                |
| 18    | Honor +3                |
| 24    | Honor +4                |

### Class Abilities

After making a melee attack using Power, Knights can use an action to make a melee attack using Honor.

### Class Perks

Knights have access to perks built on top of the core commandments of chivalry.

| Attribute | Perk             | Requirement | Description                                                                                                                                       |
| --------- | ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Strength  | **Pledged Word** | Honor 1     | _Thou shalt never lie and shalt remain faithful to thy pledged word._ You double your Speech bonus when making a promise.                         |
| Strength  | **Charge**       | Honor 2     | _Thou shalt not recoil before thine enemy._ Your movement speed is doubled for the first round of combat.                                         |
| Strength  | **Champion**     | Honor 2     | _Thou shalt be the champion of the good against evil._ Your initiative roll is automatically doubled.                                             |
| Strength  | **Bulwark**      | Honor 3     | _Thou shalt make war without cessation and without mercy._ You take only half damage when hit by an enemy with over half of its health remaining. |

## 2.5 Experience Levels

All characters begin at Level 1 and progress to subsequent levels through experience points, or XP.
Each level requires 6 XP to achieve and awards the character with one or more rewards specific to that level.

After completing a session of adventuring (typically ending in a Rest), experience points are awarded by the Game Master based on set criteria.
Each character evaluates the criteria individually with confirmation by the Game Master.
The Game Master may also choose to award additional XP beyond the criteria for significant events that represent a growth in a player's character.

### XP Criteria

- [ ] Did you participate in the session?
- [ ] Did you build on your character's personality/backstory?
- [ ] Did you defeat an enemy that posed a threat to yourself, your ideals, or your personal goal?
- [ ] Did you defeat an enemy that posed a threat to your party, its companions, or its group goal?
- [ ] Did you make strategic progress towards your personal goal?
- [ ] Did you make strategic progress towards your party's goal?

### Level Rewards

- On every level, the character will gain one skill point.
- One every 2nd level, the character will choose a new perk.
- On every 4th level, the character will gain one attribute point.
- On every 6th level, the character will evolve their class item.
- On every 8th level the character gains renown.

At Level 24, a character will have become a Legendary adventurer in the eyes of the world (see [2.9 Renown](#2.9-Renown)).

| Level | Reward(s)                                                                             |

| 24    | `+1 skill point` `+1 perk` `+1 attribute point` `+1 class item evolution` `+1 renown` |

## 2.6 Health Points

Each character has a number of health points, or HP, that measures their physical condition.
The Max HP for any character is equal to `(Level + Strength + Fortitude) x 6`.

> **Example:** A Level 5 character with Strength 4 and Fortitude 1 will have a Max HP of 60.

As a character engages in combat, they will take damage, lose HP, and face consequences (see [3.5 Death](#3.5-Death)).

## 2.7 Movement Speed

Each character has a movement speed that regulates how far they can move during combat.
Movement speed is measured in terms of grid tiles which are roughly 5ft squares.
A character's movement speed is equal to `Dexterity + Agility + 3`.

> **Example:** A character with Dexterity 3 and Agility 2 will have a movement speed of 8 tiles, or 40 feet.

Out of combat, all characters have the same movement speed of 2 miles per hour or 24 miles per day when traversing long distances.
This speed can be increased by vehicles if available in the chosen World Kit.

> Movement in combat through Rough Terrain, such as rocks, mud, debris, or water, consumes twice the amount of movement speed.

## 2.8 Carrying Capacity

Each character has a carrying capacity that determines how much gear and resources they can carry before becoming over-encumbered.
Carrying capacity is measured in terms of slots, an arbitrary unit of weight and size.
A character's carrying capacity is equal to `(Strength + Fortitude) x 3`.

> **Example:** A character with Strength 4 and Fortitude 1 will have a carrying capacity of 15 slots.

For simplicity, all items are divided into 7 size categories that correspond to a specific number of slots.

| Category       | Size      | Description           | _Vale of Myths_ Example   |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Tiny**       | 1/20 slot | Fits in a small bag   | Valerian Piece (VP)       |
| **Very Light** | 1/4 slot  | Fits in a large bag   | Arrow, adventuring ration |
| **Light**      | 1/2 slot  | Fits in one hand      | Dagger                    |
| **Average**    | 1 slot    | Fits in two hands     | Shortsword                |
| **Heavy**      | 2 slots   | Heavy in two hands    | Longsword, crossbow       |
| **Very Heavy** | 4 slots   | Fits on your shoulder | Small crate               |
| **Cumbersome** | 20 slots  | Fits on a vehicle     | Large crate               |

When a character's carrying capacity is exceeded, they become over-encumbered and no longer have the strength to move themselves.

> All items that are carried count towards a character's carrying capacity.
> This does not include items that are worn, such as armor, clothing, and backpacks.

## 2.9 Renown

Each character starts their journey with Average renown, where the world knows they are an adventurer but have heard nothing about their feats or accomplishments.
As they level up (see [2.5 Experience Levels](#2.5-Experience-Levels)), they gain renown and begin to have word of their skill spread amongst the people.
Based on their renown, characters gain advantage when making Speech checks against common NPC's.

| Renown        | Speech Advantage | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Average**   | +0               | People know you call yourself an adventurer           |
| **Rare**      | +1               | People have heard your name in passing conversation   |
| **Very Rare** | +2               | People know a full story about one of your adventures |
| **Legendary** | +3               | People think of you when thinking of an adventurer    |

## 2.10 Building a Character

# 3. Adventuring

Once you've established your Adventuring Party of characters, there's only one thing left do: adventure!
Adventuring can take many shapes and forms, but _Vade Mecum_ provides a general rule set for how to resolve the adventuring day.

## 3.1 Skill Checks

When a character performs an action of consequence, the Game Master will ask for a skill check.
This includes the player rolling a number of dice based on the character's ability and the situational nature of the action.
Then based on the roll, the Game Master will resolve the outcome.

For any skill check, the player will roll a number of D6 equal to `(Attribute + Skill + Advantage - Disadvantage)`.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

While attribute and skill dice come directly from the character's innate ability, advantage/disadvantage comes from the objects or people involved in the action.

> For any skill check, the maximum advantage that can be applied is +6 and the maximum disadvantage is -6.

Most commonly, advantage will come from an item assisting the action, and disadvantage will come from an item countering the action.
Examples of common sources of advantage/disadvantage are given below.

| Skill     | Action                          | Advantage Source | Disadvantage Source |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Power     | Melee attack                    | Weapon           | Armor, cover        |
| Precision | Pick a lock                     | Lock picking set | Lock                |
| Medicine  | Heal an incapacitated character | Medical pouch    | Injury              |
| Speech    | Persuade an NPC                 | NPC              | NPC                 |

For ambiguous sources of advantage/disadvantage, such as locks, injuries, and NPC's, the Game Master can declare a difficulty.
There are 7 levels of difficulty, ranging from Trivial (+3) to Titan (-3).
In the examples below, we look at a Speech check where the Game Master may declare a difficulty based on the NPC.

| Difficulty    | A/D | Description                                  | Example            |
| ------------- | --- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Trivial**   | +3  | Extremely simple/likely                      | Your best friend   |
| **Very Easy** | +2  | Very simple/likely                           | Your friend        |
| **Easy**      | +1  | Somewhat simple/likely                       | A friendly NPC     |
| **Average**   | +0  | Not too simple or challenging, evenly likely | An indifferent NPC |
| **Hard**      | -1  | Somewhat challenging/unlikely                | A disgruntled NPC  |
| **Very Hard** | -2  | Very challenging/unlikely                    | Your enemy         |
| **Titan**     | -3  | Extremely challenging/unlikely               | Your nemesis       |

> **Example:** A character attempts to force open a locked door. The Game Master asks for a Power check.
> The character has Strength 4 and Power 2 and is using a Crowbar (+1) to assist them.
> The Game Master sets the door's difficulty at Very Hard (-2) since it is metal and reinforced.
> The player rolls a Power check with 5 D6.

### Success, Stalemate, and Failure

After a player rolls their dice, they can evaluate the outcome based on the highest die they rolled.
In the examples below, we look at a player rolling a Power check to force open a locked door.

| Max D6     | Result        | Outcome                                          | Example                                              |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 6          | **Success**   | The character completes the action successfully. | The character forces the door open and gets inside.  |
| 5          | **Stalemate** | The character is ineffectual in their attempt.   | The character must try again or find another way in. |
| 1, 2, 3, 4 | **Failure**   | The character fails the action detrimentally.    | The character jams the door permanently closed.      |

If a character is unsuccessful, they are allowed to attempt the skill check again with the disadvantage increased by 1 (as the character is frustrated and discouraged).
In many cases, failure will mean the character botches the attempt and it can longer be attempted by them or other members of the Adventuring Party.

> **Example:** A character rolls a Precision check to pick a lock and gets a stalemate.
> The character decides to try again and rolls a Precision check with one less D6.
> This time, they get a failure. The Game Master rules the keyhole of the lock has been ruined and is now unpickable.

> Skill checks made to attack during combat are special.
> Failure will result in the weapon or tool being used taking a point of damage (see [3.2 Weapons and Tools](#3.2-Weapons-and-Tools)).

### Group Skill Checks

When a group of players is required to pass the same skill check, they will all make their own rolls.
To determine the outcome, evaluate the results of each individual skill check, ignore any stalemates, and cancel out any failures with any successes.
The final result can then be determined by taking the highest result.

> **Example:** A Party of 4 characters attempt to collectively sneak into a building.
> The Game Master calls for a group Stealth check.
> Two characters roll a success, one character rolls a stalemate, and one character rolls a failure.
> After ignoring the stalemate and canceling out the one failure with one success, there remains one success.
> The group Stealth check is ruled a success.

### Probability

In this system, there is a strong relationship between the amount of dice being rolled and the chances of success and failure.
As such, _Vade Mecum_ encourages specialization from the party, rather than a brute force mentality.
There is a negative incentive to attempt difficult and dangerous situations, and a positive incentive to find solutions that play to the party's strengths.

> For example, if a Strength 1 character attempts a Power check to force open a door, there is a high chance they hurt themself, hurt someone else, or jam the door.
> But if a Strength 6 character attempts the same check, there is a high chance they succeed and a near zero chance they fail.

The exact probabilities for any roll is given below.

| # of Dice | Success | Stalemate | Failure |
| --------- | ------- | --------- | ------- |
| 1         | 16.7%   | 16.7%     | 66.7%   |
| 2         | 30.6%   | 25.0%     | 44.4%   |
| 3         | 42.1%   | 28.2%     | 29.6%   |
| 4         | 51.8%   | 28.5%     | 19.8%   |
| 5         | 59.8%   | 27.0%     | 13.2%   |
| 6         | 66.5%   | 24.7%     | 8.8%    |
| 7         | 72.1%   | 22.1%     | 5.9%    |
| 8         | 76.7%   | 19.4%     | 3.9%    |
| 9         | 80.6%   | 16.8%     | 2.6%    |
| 10        | 83.8%   | 14.4%     | 1.7%    |
| 11        | 86.5%   | 12.3%     | 1.2%    |
| 12        | 88.8%   | 10.4%     | 0.8%    |
| 13        | 90.7%   | 8.8%      | 0.5%    |
| 14        | 92.2%   | 7.4%      | 0.3%    |
| 15        | 93.5%   | 6.3%      | 0.2%    |

## 3.2 Weapons and Tools

To gain an edge on skill checks, characters can utilize weapons and tools that give an advantage when performing skill checks.

> Individual weapons and tools are defined by the World Kit being used, but all of them follow a universal pattern for how they are defined.

Each item will specify its rarity (see [1.2 Currency](#1.2-Currency)), its size (see [2.8 Carrying Capacity](#2.8-Carrying-Capacity)), and how it can be used.
Weapons, additionally, will specify the attack range and the amount of damage dealt.

> Some examples of weapon and tools from the _Vale of Myths_ World Kit are given below.

| Item              | Rarity    | Cost    | Size     | Description                               |
| ----------------- | --------- | ------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Rope**          | Common    | 5 pcs   | 1 slot   | +1 Athletics to climb                     |
| **Lantern**       | Common    | 5 pcs   | 1/2 slot | +1 Investigation/Detection to search      |
| **Medical Pouch** | Average   | 20 pcs  | 1/2 slot | +1 Medicine to heal                       |
| **Shortsword**    | Average   | 20 pcs  | 1 slot   | +1 Power to attack, 2d6 damage, 5ft range |
| **Greatsword**    | Very Rare | 200 pcs | 2 slots  | +3 Power to attack, 4d6 damage, 5ft range |

When using a tool or weapon, a failed skill check will result in the item taking damage.
Damage results in the item's advantage modifier decreasing by one.
When an item's modifier falls below zero, it is considered broken and can no longer be used until it is repaired.
Repairs to restore the item modifier can be made during a Rest (see [3.6 Rest](#3.6-Rest)).

## 3.3 Armor and Cover

Similar to how weapons and tools assist friendly skill checks, armor and cover inhibit enemy skill checks.
There are 3 tiers of armor and cover that incrementally increase the disadvantage applied to incoming attacks.

| Tier       | Modifier | _Vale of Myths_ Armor Example | _Vale of Myths_ Cover Example |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Light**  | -1       | Leather armor                 | Foliage, fence                |
| **Medium** | -2       | Chainmail armor               | Tree, low wall                |
| **Heavy**  | -3       | Plate armor                   | Battlement                    |

> Protection given by armor and cover do stack when determining overall disadvantage.
> For example, someone wearing medium armor behind medium cover would have -4 disadvantage to being hit.

While armor protects the wearer from melee and ranged attacks, cover only protects at range.
Additionally, those in cover cannot take Movement or Actions (see [3.4 Combat](#3.4-Combat)).

## 3.4 Combat

When a situation reaches a point than can no longer be resolved by words, the Party will enter combat.
Combat begins by determining each character's turn order by rolling for initiative. Each character
rolls a number of D6 equal to `(Dexterity + Perception)` and sums the roll to resolve their initiative.

> **Example:** A character with Dexterity 4 and Perception 2 rolls 6D6 and sums the value to 23.
> Characters with a higher initiative will go before them and characters with a lower initiative will go after.

Combat will persist for a number of rounds until one side concedes or parishes.
In every round of combat, each character will take a turn in order of initiative.
During their turn, a character can take Movement and up to two Actions (in any order or configuration).

> Each round of combat is roughly equivalent to 6 seconds of world time.

### Movement

Characters can utilize their movement speed to navigate the combat area and seek cover from the enemy.

| Type           | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Move**       | Move a number of tiles up to your movement speed                  |
| **Take Cover** | Take cover behind an object by consuming half your movement speed |

### Action (2x)

Characters can use an action to perform a skill check or interact with objects in the combat area.
Of there two actions, a character can only use one to make an attack (unless otherwise specified by a perk or class.)

| Type                        | Example                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Roll a Skill Check**      | Roll Power to make a melee attack, roll Investigation to search for an exit |
| **Interact with an Object** | Consume a potion, open a door, throw an object                              |

### Reaction

Additionally, characters can take one reaction per round that is prompted by the movement or action of another character.
By default, all characters can perform an opportunity attack as a reaction, but classes and perks may give access to other types of reactions.

| Reaction               | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opportunity Attack** | When an enemy within 5 feet moves away from you, you can make an attack against that enemy. |

### Surprise

In some cases, the Party may attempt to surprise their enemy to gain an advantage.
To do this, one character from the party will roll a Stealth check with a difficulty modifier equivalent to the highest enemy Detection.

| Result        | Outcome                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Success**   | The party surprises the enemy, earning a free round while the enemies are surprised. |
| **Stalemate** | The party fails to surprise the enemy and begin combat as usual.                     |
| **Failure**   | The party prematurely alerts the enemy, giving them a free round for movement only.  |

> **Example:** A party attempts to surprise a group of soldiers on patrol. The soldiers are led by a Scout with Detection 2.
> The character leading the party rolls a Stealth check with Very Hard (-2) difficulty and is successful.
> The party surprised the enemies and gets a free round against them.

### Looting

After completing a bout of combat, characters have the ability to search for spoils of their labor.
To do so, each player makes an Investigation check.
On a success, they either recover a usable item from a fallen enemy or find an amount of currency equal to `(Level + Perception + Investigation) x D6`.

> **Example:** A Level 3 character with Perception 4 and Investigation 1 could find between 8 and 48 units of currency after passing an Investigation check.

## 3.5 Death

During combat, every character faces the possibility of death.
When a character's HP is reduced to 0, they are incapacitated and incur an injury.
There are 6 levels of injury with 6 degrees therein.

Immediately after being incapacitated, the player will roll a D6 to determine their character's injury level and another D6 to determine the injury degree.
A table of all injuries are given at the end of this section.

### Recoverable Injuries

If a character incurs an injury that is Minor (6), Moderate (5), or Serious (4), they will recover in a given number of rounds.
To accelerate their recovery, the injured player themself or another player within 5ft can roll a Medicine check with the given advantage/disadvantage.
If the roll is successful, the character is stabilized with 1 HP and they are back in the fight.

### Deadly Injuries

If a character incurs an injury that is Severe (3), Critical (2), or Fatal (1), they will die in a give number of rounds.
To prevent their death, another player within 5ft must roll a Medicine check with the given advantage/disadvantage.
If the roll is successful, the character is stabilized with 1 HP and they are back in the fight, but wounded.
A wounded character has their movement speed reduced by half until their next Rest.

> While incapacitated, all attacks on the character are Trivial (+3) and increase the level of injury by one.

| D6  | Injury Level | Effect             | D6  | Injury Degree               | Difficulty     |

## 3.6 Rest

After a day of adventuring, the party is required to rest for 8 hours to refresh their minds and bodies.
During these 8 hours, characters will engage in a mix of sleeping and a single Rest Activity.
Any Rest Activity permitted by the Game Master will be evaluated by a skill check.
The most common Rest Activities are given below.

| Rest Activity          | Skill      | Success                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Keep watch for enemies | Detection  | Force an enemy's surprise attack to automatically fail (if present) |
| Heal a character       | Medicine   | Double the HP gained by a character who is satiated                 |
| Repair a damaged item  | Innovation | Restore a damaged item's bonus by 1                                 |

> If a Rest is interrupted for more than 4 hours, it must be restarted.

### Lodging

In order to rest, the Adventuring Party must find lodging in the embrace of nature or in the civilized world.
Finding established lodging will grant advantage on Rest Activities and can stave off the dangers of the wild.
The Game Master will decide whether NPC-provided lodging is available in any given location.

| Lodging              | Rarity     | Cost   | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adventuring Camp** | Ubiquitous | Free   | A cold place to sleep                                     |
| **Simple Lodging**   | Average    | 20 CU  | A warm place to sleep, +1 to Rest Activity rolls          |
| **Fancy Lodging**    | Rare       | 100 CU | A warm and safe place to sleep, +3 to Rest Activity rolls |

### Meals

To recover HP naturally during a Rest, characters can consume meals to satiate themselves with food and drink.
Depending on the quality, a meal will satiate a character for one or more Rests.
The Game Master will decide whether NPC-cooked meals are available in any given location.

| Meal                   | Rarity      | Cost  | Description                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Adventuring Ration** | Very Common | 1 CU  | Satiates a character for 1 Rest, carried in 1/4 slot |
| **Simple Meal**        | Common      | 5 CU  | Satiates a character for 2 Rests, cannot be carried  |
| **Fancy Meal**         | Average     | 20 CU | Satiates a character for 4 Rests, cannot be carried  |

Characters that are satiated at the end of a Rest will heal a number of HP equal to `(Strength + Fortitude) x D6`.

> A character does not gain any benefit from eating additional meals while already satiated.

### Exhaustion

If an Adventuring Party cannot complete a Rest for any reason, they will gain a level of Exhaustion.
For each level, a character suffers -1 disadvantage on rolls for Strength, Intelligence, and Perception.
A character can at most have 3 levels of Exhaustion.
